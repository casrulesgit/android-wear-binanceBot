This is a Wear OS Application for Binance to keep you updated right from your wrist.

## Features provided for now:
*Percentage change for every asset your currently holding since start up
*long/short liquidation notification for every open order
*notification if an asset starts a major move to the upside or downside
*current price and 5m change of your most active asset atm
*overall balance displayed at all time

## Set it up
For now run it in Android Studio. There is no apk, because the API keys need to be added.
just add api keys in the string.xml like this:
```
<string name="api_key">COPY API KEY HERE</string>
<string name="secret">COPY SECRET KEY HERE</string>
```
If you have any ideas on improving the app, just let me now.
